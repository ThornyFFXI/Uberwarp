Uberwarp is a plugin used to trigger NPC warp systems via command line.  See HTML doc for full information.

# Installation

1. Download the plugin release zip that matches your ashita installation's interface version from the releases area on the right side.
2. Extract the entire zip to your ashita folder(the folder containing ashita.dll and ashita-cli.exe). Everything will fall into place.
3. Load with '/load uberwarp' or add the same line to your startup script. Uberwarp is a plugin not an addon, so do not use '/addon load'.
